## About SEER

This library was developed through the [SEER](http://seer.cancer.gov/) program.

The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program is a premier source for cancer statistics in the United States.
The SEER program collects information on incidence, prevalence and survival from specific geographic areas representing
a large portion of the US population and reports on all these data plus cancer mortality data for the entire country.
